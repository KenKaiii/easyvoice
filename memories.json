Increased max_tokens from 500 to 2000 in settings.py to accommodate gpt-5-nano reasoning tokens\n2. Created new OpenAI LLM interface (llm_openai.py) with better debugging for empty responses  \n3. Updated VoiceAgent core to support OpenAI provider selection\n4. This resolved \"I'm sorry, I couldn't process that request\" errors when asking memory questions like \"what did i ask you so far\"\n\nThe memory system now works correctly in chat mode when using OpenAI models.
